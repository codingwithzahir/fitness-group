    Whether you work out in a CrossFit Box, a commercial gym, or in a home gym, there is little denying the importance of a dedicated space to train. It is a place where 
        the body is tested, strengthened, and changed. It is a place where athletes train for competition, others train to recover from illness, and some train to achieve the body of their dreams. 
        In short, there is no denying the weird but important place that the gym holds in many of our lives.</p>
